# SecuriKeyGUI
SecuriKey is the simple and easy way to keep your passwords safe! Simply download the SecuriKey.exe file from the build folder, and move it to a USB flash drive. Once it is moved over, open and run the exe.

## Setting up a user password
Setting up a user password is easy! When running SecuriKey for the first time, this window will appear.

Enter the password you wish to use in order to access your saved passwords.
This password will be hashed using SHA256, and stored in a txt file named user.

## Login
After setting up a password, SecuriKey will ask for this password before allowing you to view, add, edit, or remove passwords.
