SecuriKey is the simple and easy way to keep your passwords safe! Simply download the SecuriKey.exe file from the build folder, and move it to a USB flash drive. Once it is moved over, open and run the exe.

## Setting up a user password
Setting up a user password is easy! When running SecuriKey for the first time, this window will appear.

## Password Security

After closing the application, all passwords will be stored in a txt file called Passwords. They are encrypted for security, and only decrypted when logged into the application and viewing the password.

## Final Remarks

That is about all you need to know to use this simple application. It is recommended to keep the USB drive unplugged from your device when not actively looking up a password. Even though the passwords are all securely encrypted, keeping the drive offline gives hackers a 0% chance of accessing your passwords remotely.

Have fun, and stay safe out there!
